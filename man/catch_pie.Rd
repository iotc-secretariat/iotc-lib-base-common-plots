\title{Plots nominal catches by species as a pie chart. The original data should be grouped by year
and a factor (e.g. species, species group, fleet etc.) that's also used to colorize the bars}

  data,
  fill_by,
  max_categories = NA,
  colors = NA,
  num_legend_rows = 2,
  callouts = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing nominal catches by \code{YEAR} and a given factor}

\item{fill_by}{The name of the column to be used to colorize the bar components}

\item{max_categories}{The number of maximum distinct categories (from the \code{fill_by} column) to be kept in the result. Everything else will be aggregated as 'All others'}

\item{colors}{A data frame containing the colors (FILL and OUTLINE) for the factors, if set to \code{NA} these will be determined by the \code{FILL_BY} parameter}

\item{num_legend_rows}{The number of rows to display in the legend}

\item{callouts}{If \code{TRUE} plots informative callouts for each category}

\value{
the plot corresponding to the given input parameters
